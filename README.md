# Bamazon
This assignmet marked our first steps into the world of MySQL and queries written to and calling SQL. It was our job to create a server side Amazon clone called Bamazon that we would populate with products in different departments at different prices and with different quantitites in stock. The user would access the bamazon app with node and use the app to select which department and product they would like. Following that they would then have the total price of their order displayed to them and the quantity would update to reflect that a certain item or items had a depleted stock. We use MySQL to create the database that held the information of the products and created queries to display that to the user in Node and then to place their order which would affect the display and the MySQL database. It was the first time we had a server up and running and used MySQL in conjuction with node.
Tools used: MySQL, SQL workbench, Node.JS, CSV, JavaScript.
